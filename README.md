# Installation

# Usage
In order to use this app, When the user runs node app in the terminal - in the same directory - they will be asked if they would like to add a manager, engineer, or intern to the team. Once the user decides which role they would like to add; a list of questions will follow depending on which option the user picks. For example, if you pick Engineer; the program will ask for the github username; whereas the intern question is what school is the intern attending. Once the user finishes adding users to their team, the program will automatically generate new team information in the team.html file under the output folder. Open this in a browser to see the information for the team!
